# Melanoma Classification Exercise

## Idea

In this exercise I want to classify images from human skins into different melanoma diagnostic categories.
The used dataset was used for the ISIC 2019 challenge and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/isic-2019?resource=download&select=ISIC_2019_Training_Input).
